The Drupal CMS has a vast community and fokus on accessibility, security, backwarts compatibility and stability. It is very flexible and highly expandable (>3000 actively maintained modules), but coding in Drupal has a high learning curve. Drupal is written in PHP, but offers the possibility to encapsulate javascript software, so you can write and (with some coding) reuse JS-packages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Drupal has a core suppurt basic [field types, field widgets and field formatters](https://www.drupal.org/docs/drupal-apis/entity-api/fieldtypes-fieldwidgets-and-fieldformatters), but could be extended with modules, i. e. for [geospatial data](https://www.drupal.org/project/geofield), or custom field types can be developed. In additon to that, WYSIWYG Editors like [CKEditor](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/index.html) or [N1ED](https://n1ed.com/doc/edit-config) supports own input formats.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

In most cases, users use moduls to customize the playback of audio files (e.g. with [AudioField](https://www.drupal.org/project/audiofield)) or how images are displayed (e.g. with [Colorbox](https://www.drupal.org/project/colorbox)). WissKI also offers the possibility to integrate 3D objects (via [Sketchfab](https://www.drupal.org/project/sketchfab) and [Kompakkt](https://www.drupal.org/project/kompakkt)), geospatial data e.g. with [Leaflet](https://www.drupal.org/project/leaflet), and the possibility to display and annotate images IIIF-capable (via [WissKI Mirador 3 Integration](https://wiss-ki.eu/documentation/data-modeling/pathbuilder/configuration/images/wisski-mirador-integration)). |

In addition to that, Drupal do not implement asynchronious data loading (yet). Lots of entity references can slow down the system, so caching and index mechanism should be implemented.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
